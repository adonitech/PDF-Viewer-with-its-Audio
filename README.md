# PDF Viewer with its audio

You can listen while reading the book and actually helped me to learn english

What i did was, the book is in English and i will find that book translated into amharic and then find its audiobook then i will read the book in english while listening to amharic that is fucking awesome

## In Progress

If want to use it, you need to create assets/ directory

```javascript
// This is for Atomic habits book, okay?
for (let i = 1; i <= 21; i++) {
  audioFiles.push(`assets/AChapter${i}.mp3`);
}
```

The app needs book.pdf(the book that will be rendered) and some audio files

I'm Working on it
access the file from the internet and render it in the app

### and anyone who want to help me???
